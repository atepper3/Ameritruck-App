currently, we have the following components:

AddMultipleTrucksForm.js
     -This has form fields that add several trucks to the database at once
CommissionCalculator.js
     -This performs the math involved in calculating commissions after entered in commission form
CommissionForm.js
      -This component creates new commissions
CommissionList.js
      -This should be one of the tabs of the truck and displays all commissions related to a specific truck
ContactsManager.js
      -Lists and handles the adding of contacts, independent of the truck collection.  However, at some point soon, I will want to implement a way of getting it to talk to the truck collection.  For example, when adding a new truck, having the option to choose the contact and have it auto populate certain pieces of their information in the relevant fields
ExpenseForm.js
     -The form that creates new expenses
ExpenseList.js
       -The tab that displays the relevant expenses for a certain truck
Navigation.js
       -Something we created to display the navbar.  Currently, we have code in there to display information in the center of the navbar if viewing details about the truck.  However, this code might be better served to be placed somewhere else, as currently it doens't always render correctly depending on which component you are in
TruckDetails.js
          -the old state management code we used to use.  Should be obsolete now that we are using redux, but potentially some useful code in there
TruckForm.js
      -used to add a single truck, similar in purpose to add multiple trucks
Truckinfo.js
       -the first page that shows upafter clicking more details on the trucklist page, and displays all the fields about the truck
Trucklist.js
          -currently our "homepage" where we list some information about all trucks.
