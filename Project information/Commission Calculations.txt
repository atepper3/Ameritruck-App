Here is the current structure of commissions calculations:

First, we calculate gross profit.  This is sale price - purchase price - total expenses.

Then we have commission types. There is a buyer flat commission and a buyer %.  Then, there is a seller flat commission, and a seller %.

Flat commissions work as you would expect, there is any kind of number in there.  For percentage commissions, they will only ever be either 10% or 15%.

Percentage commissions, whether they are buyer or seller, are only calculated after all flat commissions, buyer or seller, have been calculated.  For example
for a 10% buyer commission, you would take gross profit and subtract any flat commissions out, and then take 10% of that number.  Same idea with seller commissions.  However, these fields need to be able
to adjust if flat commissions are added or subtracted later, as they depend on the flat commissions.  It may be helpful to assign an arbitrary const such as
"adjustedGrossProfit" that takes gross profit and subtracts out total flat seller commissions and totalflat buyer commissions

Commissions should be totaled in rows as total buyer commissions and total seller commissions, with a total commissions row under that.  For total buyer and total seller, we are not distinguishing by flat or percentage,
it is all buyer commissions and all seller commissions that we want displayed.
